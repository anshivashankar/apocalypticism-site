# Apocalypticism in Modern Media - An interactive exploration

This website was made for PHIL 1260 - Apocalypticism in Film by Ashwin ShivaShankar.

It is intended to inform the reader about a variety of different apocalyptic media, as well as some symbolism and imagery that exists in each work.

There is no obvious grouping to this list, other than all of these titles relating to apocalyptic media.
